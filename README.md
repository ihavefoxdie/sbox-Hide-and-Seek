# Hide&Seek
https://asset.party/purpeliz/hide_seek_updated
#### A game of hide and seek for s&box.

Hide! Don't let seekers catch you! <br>
Seek! Hunt down every hider!

Currently you can create sessions or join them. Prior to starting a session, you need to select a map to play on (any map from asset.party can be played on).
As for the actual game logic, it's fully functional.

As for nice little things, I plan on incorporating scoring system (to make scoreboard actually a scoreboard, lol!).

Known issues:
- There are a few issues with the character component (minor movement bugs).
- Sounds might act funny at times.

Later down the line, I would like to refactor the player logic. For that, I would want to rearrange the components within and rewrite certain things to make controls a little nicer (like, camera movement logic and character rotation).

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to express them here or in discord "waywo" channel under the Hide&Seek post in the official s&box server.



The game is still under heavy development.
